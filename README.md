# Vpotify
This script allows you to easily transfer audios from VK to Spotify

Currently available only for Windows

I recommend downloadinf the .rar file, it contains an executable and all the files needed. 
If you are going to execute .py script yourself, make sure to either put chromedriver.exe in the Python root folder or change the way to it in the code. 
I am using web scraping via selenium, since all the actions with audios in VK API stopped working in 2016.

If you have Chrome installed, I recommend choosing it in the menu. The other option is Yandex browser, which is kinda experimental. I plan on implementing Edge soon, though it doesn't seem to have the same plans.

Feel free to modify and change my code, I am sure there are faster or more elegant ways to do this.
